# A simple todo webapp
 A todo webapp using Django, HMTL, CSS, Bootstrap
 
I am a beginner in learning **Django**. I have previously watched few videos of building WebApp with Djano, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap. Now i have build a small project fully on my own. This is a **Todo-WebApp**.

Functionality of this Webapp are:
1. Registration System.
2. Login and Logout system.
3. Add todos.
4. Select and Delete todos.
5. Multiple user handeling.
6. Simple Web interface.
